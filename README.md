# Deregulation-of-Intrastate-Trucking
This project was done to analyze the affects of the deregulation of the intrastate trucking industry.

Along with a couple of classmates, this project was done as the final for a linear regression course during my graduate 
studies at CSULB. The goal of the project was to assess how the deregulation of the prices charged for motor 
transport services in Florida would affect future prices. To this this, we used a linear model with interaction terms to
predict the future price values. The analysis also includes the use of correlations, stepwise selection criteria, and 
identifying both influential and non-influential outliers in the data.
