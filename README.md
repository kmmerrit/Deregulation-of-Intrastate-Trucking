# Deregulation-of-Intrastate-Trucking
This project was done to analyze the affects of the deregulation of the intrastate trucking industry.

Along with a couple of classmates, this project was done as the final for a linear regression course during my graduate 
studies at CSULB. The goal of the project was to assess the impact that deregulation of the prices charged for motor 
transport services in Florida would affect future prices by predicting them. It includes the use of correlations, stepwise 
selection criteria, and identifying both influential and non-influential outliers in the data.
